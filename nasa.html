      <p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, /ˈnæsə/)
        is an independent agency of the United States Federal Government
         responsible for the civilian space program, as well as aeronautics
          and aerospace research.[note 1] NASA was established in 1958,
           succeeding the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics
           (NACA). The new agency was to have a distinctly civilian
            orientation, encouraging peaceful applications in space
            science.[7][8][9] Since its establishment, most US space
             exploration efforts have been led by NASA, including the
             Apollo Moon landing missions, the Skylab space station,
             and later the Space Shuttle. NASA is supporting the
              International Space Station and is overseeing the development
               of the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, the Space Launch
                System and Commercial Crew vehicles. The agency is also
                 responsible for the Launch Services Program which provides
                  oversight of launch operations and countdown management
                  for unmanned NASA launches.NASA science is focused on better
                   understanding Earth through the Earth Observing System;[10]
                   advancing heliophysics through the efforts of the Science Mission
                    Directorate's Heliophysics Research Program;[11] exploring bodies
                     throughout the Solar System with advanced robotic spacecraft
                      missions such as New Horizons;[12] and researching astrophysics
                       topics, such as the Big Bang, through the Great Observatories
                        and associated programs.[13]

                         From 1946, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) had been experimenting with rocket planes such as the supersonic Bell X-1.[14] In the early 1950s, there was challenge to launch an artificial satellite for the International Geophysical Year (1957–58). An effort for this was the American Project Vanguard. After the Soviet launch of the world's first artificial satellite (Sputnik 1) on October 4, 1957, the attention of the United States turned toward its own fledgling space efforts. The US Congress, alarmed by the perceived threat to national security and technological leadership (known as the "Sputnik crisis"), urged immediate and swift action; President Dwight D. Eisenhower and his advisers counseled more deliberate measures. On January 12, 1958, NACA organized a "Special Committee on Space Technology", headed by Guyford Stever.[9] On January 14, 1958, NACA Director Hugh Dryden published "A National Research Program for Space Technology" stating:[15]

      It is of great urgency and importance to our country both from consideration of our prestige as a nation as well as military necessity that this challenge [Sputnik] be met by an energetic program of research and development for the conquest of space
